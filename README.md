This package contains the **named arguments based** function [curryMultiple](https://github.com/getify/fpo/blob/master/docs/core-API.md#fpocurrymultiple) from the [FPO](https://github.com/getify/fpo) project by [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify).

Copied from version [5.2.3](https://github.com/getify/fpo/tree/5.2.3) of FPO.

**NOTE** this function has not itself been `curryMultiple`ed (i.e. it is a normal JS function and is not curried in any way). See [getify's comment](https://github.com/getify/fpo/issues/16#issuecomment-287787792) for more info.
